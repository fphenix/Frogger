# Frogger
Frogger game in Processing


Rules:

Why does the frog cross the road? 
"To go to the other side" some would say, but no, simply to go back home after grocery-shopping.

But the life of a frog is a very dangerous one indeed.

First it has to cross a busy road, avoiding the heavy metal beasts. Be careful as they won't.
Just the time to take a deep breath on the safty zone, and the next challenge arises. 
Frogs love water, but this river is infested with gators and piranhas. 
Thanksfully, the turtles offer a shelter for a little while, but watch out, they go underwater every so often. 
Floating logs can also help, but the current is strong (...with this one...), and you don't want to slip off.
A last final jump and you are safe home... but the rest of your family must follow.

Once 4 frogs are saved, you win! Frogs are safe, World is saved, Trump is defeated.

Some tweaking, beautifying and finishing-up would be required, but...
